# NYC 311 Service Requests Data Analysis

## **1. Project Overview**

This project performs a full data analytics workflow on the NYC 311 Service Requests dataset. The workflow covers:

* Data ingestion using SQLite
* Data cleaning and profiling
* Data visualization
* Statistical analysis (linear regression)
* Interpretation and reporting

The goal is to explore complaint trends, assess response times, and provide insights for decision-making.

## **2. Dataset**

* **Source:** [NYC Open Data – 311 Service Requests](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/ny-311-service-requests)
* **Time period covered:** 2010 – Present (subset used for analysis)
* **Number of records:** 5,000,000 (subset)
* **Number of variables:** 12 selected columns
* **Unit of observation:** Individual 311 service request

---

## **3. File Structure**

* `nyc311_queries.sql` → All SQL queries used to load, clean, and extract the dataset
* `nyc311_notebook.ipynb` → Full Python analysis, visualizations, and statistical modeling
* `data_profile.html` → Automated data profiling report
* `README.md` → Project instructions and summary

---

## **4. Environment / Requirements**

* **Python:** 3.9+
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels, ydata_profiling, scikit-learn
* **Database:** SQLite

---

## **5. Reproducing the Analysis**

1. Ensure Python 3.9+ and required libraries are installed.
2. Place the CSV dataset in `../data/311-service-requests-from-2010-to-present.csv` (or update the path in notebook).
3. Run `nyc311_queries.sql` or execute the notebook to load data into SQLite.
4. Open `nyc311_notebook.ipynb` and run all cells sequentially.
5. View `data_profile.html` for a detailed data profile report.

## **6. Key Outputs**

* **Data Profiling Report:** Provides overview, missing values, duplicates, univariate stats, outliers, correlations, and data quality summary.
* **Visualizations:** 6 charts covering complaints over time, top complaint types, borough distribution, and other insights.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Linear regression predicting response time using complaint type, borough, and timestamps. Interpretation included.

## **7. Notes / Assumptions**

* Only a subset of 5M rows was used due to memory constraints.
* Missing or invalid dates were handled with coercion and filtering.
* Regression model assumes linearity and normality of residuals.
